(* The following expression is currently not supported
    ```let a = (let f x = x in (f 5, f "foo")```) because:
    - Expressions of the form ```let a = <expr>, where <expr> is not a pure
        expressions, are not supported.
    - Expressions similar to ```let f x = x in (f 5, f "foo")``` are not
        supported. Type checking fails with error
        "Typing error: Cannot unify int = string".
